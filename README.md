# 🎮 Monster Mayhem

## 🧩 Introduction
**Monster Mayhem** is an exciting web-based board game that introduces players to a 10x10 grid of interconnected hexagons.  
This project focuses on essential functionalities such as highlighting hexagons, enabling selection and deselection, and incorporating asynchronous data processing.  

Additional challenges include adding new mechanics like **character movement** and **path highlighting**.  
Through this project, I demonstrate **problem-solving** and **troubleshooting skills** to create a seamless and interactive gaming experience.

## 🕹️ Game Rules
- The goal of *Monster Mayhem* is to **find the 5 monsters hidden on the board**.  
- The game is designed for **two players**, each with a distinct color scheme:
  - 🟡 **Player 1:** Gold

- Players take turns clicking on hexagons, marking their moves with their respective colors.  
- When a player discovers a monster:
  - The hexagon turns **purple** 💜  
  - A purple indicator appears next to the player’s name.

## 🧠 Troubleshooting & Development Process

### 🔹 Reorganization of Elements (HTML)
Reorganized the layout by moving the monster counters into a new container.  
This improved positioning and made it possible to place the counters on each side of the board for better visual balance.

### 🎨 Styling of New Elements (CSS)
Styled the new elements, ensuring proper alignment and seamless integration with the existing design.  
Visual consistency was maintained across the entire board.

### ⚙️ Update of Event Listeners (JavaScript)
Kept the hexagon interactivity intact after layout changes.  
Players can still click and mark hexagons without losing functionality.

### 👾 Monster Counting & Display Logic (JavaScript)
Implemented logic to count and display the number of monsters found by each player.  
When a player discovers a monster, their counter increases and a monster icon appears beside their name.
